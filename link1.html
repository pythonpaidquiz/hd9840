<p>
<span>this is all about how I feel about you:::</span><br>
Frankly speaking I feel very insecure about you
I get angry when you speak with any other boy other than me.
I get worried if you are in a trouble.
I feel tensed while you were writing exam or waiting for results.
Do you know why would I fake sometimes I just want you to make better at that moment and feel happy for few days.
When you said you didn't wrote a exam well,I admit that i wrote worst then you stop feeling bad for yourself 
and instead try to give me hope that I will do well...Remembered?
But sometimes I really get scared.
I will be most most happiest person if you study because I like it when u do that....
When I feel low I just call you and after that I wil be super cool.

it sounds weird but the fact is I do care about you a lot and I can promise one thing
 I'll be there for you always nomatter what situation it is...
